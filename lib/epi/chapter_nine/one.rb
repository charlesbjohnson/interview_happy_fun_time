    # Design a stack that supports a max operation, which returns the maximum value
    # stored in the stack, and throws an exception if the stack is empty. Assume elements
    # are comparable. All operations must be O(1) time. If the stack contains n elements,
    # you can use O(n) space, in addition to what is required for the elements themselves.

    # See the actual implementation for more information, as well as the corresponding suite of tests.
